    <h1>PUSH TURN MOVE looks like a beautiful book about electronic instruments</h1>
<p><b>26 Oct 2017</b></p>

<p>I saw a post about <a href="https://www.pushturnmove.com/">PUSH TURN MOVE</a> a couple of weeks ago on <a href="http://www.synthanatomy.com/">Synth Anatomy</a> (which is looking a lot more polished these days!).</p>
<p>It looks like a beautiful coffee table book and great reference for electronic musical instruments.  I don't have a copy but am tempted to pick one up for fun and inspiration.  In addition to covering hardware interfaces it looks like the book also examines software-based instruments and mobile applications in particular.  It'd be cool to see these instruments, their development, and approaches to interface put into a historical/evolutionary context.</p>
<p>Definitely on my wish list.</p>

It wasn't especially useful.</p>
