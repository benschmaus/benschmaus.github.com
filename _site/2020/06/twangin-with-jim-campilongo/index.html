    <h1>Twangin' with Jim Campilongo</h1>
<p><b>29 Jun 2020</b></p>

<p>I've been listening to a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Campilongo">Jim Campilongo</a> lately.  In addition to combing through his albums on Spotify, I've gone through a couple of his <a href="https://www.jimcampilongo.com/lessons.html">lessons</a>, which are pretty excellent.  They're not video based but each lesson comes with tablature and audio files (explanations and breakdowns of all the lesson material).  I thought I'd miss written music accompanying the tab but the format actually works well.  If you're an intermediate or advanced player I recommend checking out a lesson or two.</p>

<p>Jim also has some content on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jimcampilongo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a>.  Looks like a mix of guitar musings with some shorter lessons and playing tips.  I haven't gotten around to checking that out yet as I've been enjoying the standalone lessons.</p>

<p>Even if you're not a guitarist, if you appreciate good musicianship and improvisational music, you might enjoy the music.  All his <a href="https://www.jimcampilongo.com/music.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">albums</a> are solid, but if you're not sure where to start his latest, <em>Last Night, This Morning</em>, is a good choice.</p>
