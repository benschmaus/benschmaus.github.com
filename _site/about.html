    <p>Thanks for checking out Factotumo.com!</p>

<h1 id="short-story">Short Story</h1>

<p>Factotumo is about music and code.</p>

<h1 id="longer-story">Longer Story</h1>

<p>I’ve been a musician since I was a kid and discovered the electric guitar in my teens.</p>

<p>I enjoyed playing the guitar and learning about music so much that I went to college to study music technology.  I got to be a better musician and got pretty handy with computers.</p>

<p>Around the time of my graduation, the Internet was working its way into mainstream culture and there were lots of companies looking for people who could make web pages.  Having taken some multimedia classes as part of my schoolwork, I knew the basics of making web sites.  I started spending less time making music and a lot of time learning how to make web pages.  I got pretty good at it and have been working on software professionally for many years.</p>

<p>Music is still important to me and I aspire to spend more time on it.  So I’m working on this site in part as a way to put some music and related media into the world and to keep track of things that are interesting to me (and maybe you, too!).</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
