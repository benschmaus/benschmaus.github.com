<p>You may have noticed that there hasn't been an updated post here for awhile.</p>
<p>Well, it's been a busy few weeks for me and my family.  We've been in Silicon Valley for the past five years, and we're getting ready to move back to Philadelphia this June.  There's a a lot to do between now and then!</p>
<p>So I'm going to be taking some time off to focus on the move and I'm going to take a little break from Factotumo as well.  Don't worry, though.  I have a number of ideas for things to write about and I plan to start posting regularly again sometime in July.</p>
<p>And if there's anything in particular you'd like me to write about let me know!</p>
