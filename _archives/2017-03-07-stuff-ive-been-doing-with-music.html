<p>Despite not posting for awhile, I've been pretty busy with music-related projects.</p>
<p>I've become more interested in programmatic composition and have spent some time with <a href="http://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a> and a Scala API for SuperCollider called <a href="https://sciss.github.io/ScalaCollider/">ScalaCollider</a>.</p>
<p>I've also started looking at <a href="http://audiokit.io/">AudioKit</a> for audio programming for Mac/iOS.  The audio engine for AudioKit is an open source library called <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/Soundpipe">SoundPipe</a>, and reading about it I discovered a cool little audio language called <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/Sporth">Sporth</a>.  I don't have the hang of writing Sporth patches quite yet but it looks like a nice language for experimenting with sound design.</p>
<p>Then there's <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/en/bitwig-studio/bitwig-studio-2">Bitwig Studio 2.0</a>.  I participated in their beta test program and upgraded to v2 last week.  I haven't spent too much time with it yet, but the new interface is growing on me.  They've streamlined the UI quite a bit and the new modulation system is a lot of fun.  I noticed that the <a href="https://factotumo.com/2016/12/new-bitwig-script-for-arturia-beatstep-pro/">Arturia BeatstepPro script</a> I wrote awhile ago doesn't work in 2.0 so I've got to spend some time debugging that at some point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And last but certainly not least I've been working with Peter Kirn and James Grahame on a project that I'm excited to write more about soon!</p>
