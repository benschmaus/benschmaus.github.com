<p><em><strong>Update, 12/29/2017:</strong> Koen sent a note on <a href="https://twitter.com/AutumnKid/status/944653750668546048">Twitter</a> mentioning that the album can be pre-ordered at <a href="http://sidpop64.com">sidpop64.com</a>.</em></p>
<p>Back in March, <a class="hero__link remote_modal_dialog js-update-text-color" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amicomretrobooks/sid-waves-a-vinyl-tribute-to-the-commodore-64-sid/creator_bio" data-modal-class="modal_project_by" data-modal-title="About the creator">Koen De Brabander</a> launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amicomretrobooks/sid-waves-a-vinyl-tribute-to-the-commodore-64-sid/description">Kickstarter</a> to create an album in tribute to the <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/SID">C64 SID chip</a>.  Earlier this week the album, SID Waves, was released.  More than being a tribute to the C64, it's a throwback to 80s synth pop music.</p>
<p>The album is made with synths from the era plus, of course, the SID.  The result is an album that fits right in with the music of the period.  The SID sounds are recognizable yet the songs are much more than chip tunes.  It's really an 80s synth pop album with the SID playing a complementary role rather than being the star in its own right.</p>
<p>Here's a video overview of the album. A few tracks from the album are available on bandcamp at <a href="https://chaosgenerator.bandcamp.com/album/sid-waves">https://chaosgenerator.bandcamp.com/album/sid-waves</a> and hopefully the full album will be available to non-backers soon.</p>
