<p>I wrote about <a href="https://blend.io">Blend</a> awhile back in part 1 of my making music on the web posts.  (You can read about that <a href="https://factotumo.com/2015/09/music-gets-social-with-splice-kompoz-and-blend/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>In that post I looked at a few collaborative music platforms: Splice, Kompoz, and Blend.  Of the 3, Blend looked the most interesting.  One of the reasons is that it supports a broad set of DAWs (including Bitwig Studio!) and lets you use stem files if your DAW isn't supported natively.</p>
<p>Today, ROLI, maker of the expressive <a href="https://factotumo.com/2015/09/seaboard-rise-from-roli/">Seaboard RISE controller</a>, <a href="https://www.roli.com/blog/blend-joins-roli">announced</a> that it has acquired Blend.  It's an interesting move and, considering that ROLI also <a href="https://www.roli.com/blog/roli-welcomes-juce">acquired</a> <a href="http://www.juce.com/">JUCE</a>, gives ROLI a wide breadth of coverage across the hardware, software, and online worlds.  JUCE is a fundamental part of ROLI's <a href="https://www.roli.com/equator">Equator synth</a> that complements the Seaboard controllers, and I'm curious to see how ROLI uses the new Blend acquisition to support its larger strategy.</p>
