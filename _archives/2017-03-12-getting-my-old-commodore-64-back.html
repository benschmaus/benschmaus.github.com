<p>Turns out my old Commodore 64 has been sitting around in my parents' basement for the last 30 some years.  They're bringing it with them on an upcoming visit to Philadelphia.  I'm really excited to hook everything up and power it on.  I'm hoping it's still in working order and I can coax some gnarly tones out of its <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/SID">SID chip</a>.  Coincidentally, I've seen a couple of c64 posts over at Synthtopia in the last two days.</p>
<p>The first one links to this video from <a href="http://www.the8bitguy.com/">the 8-bit guy</a> who demos a Sequential Music Mate keyboard.</p>

<p>And earlier today I caught a post about a Kickstarter to create a documentary that tells the story of Commodore and the developers who wrote software for it.  It's called "<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yousee3d/the-commodore-story-changing-the-world-8-bits-at-a?ref=email"><em>The Commodore Story - Changing the world 8 bits at a time</em></a>" and it sounds highly promising.  Notwithstanding the fact that they're already funded, I decided to get in on some of the backer action.  I have a lot of fond memories of sitting in front of my Commodore playing games and noodling around with little <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> programs (which were entirely un-useful but fun to me at the time).  The filmmaker, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7760385/">Steven Fletcher</a>, makes a good pitch for the film.  Hopefully it'll make its way out into the world later this year.</p>
