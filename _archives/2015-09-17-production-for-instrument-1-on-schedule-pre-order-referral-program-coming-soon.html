<p>[<em><strong>Update, 9/19:</strong> Artiphon <a href="https://factotumo.com/2015/09/artiphon-evaluating-mpe-for-instrument-1/">replied via Twitter</a> that they're evaluating MPE for the INSTRUMENT 1.</em>]</p>
<p>The INSTRUMENT 1 is a unique MIDI controller by Nashville-based music tech startup <a href="http://www.artiphon.com/">Artiphon</a>.  They ran a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artiphon/introducing-the-artiphon-instrument-1/description">Kickstarter campaign</a> (raising $1.3M with more than 3k backers) that started back in March of this year and they're working towards a ship date of early 2016 for campaign backers.</p>
<p>An update went out to backers yesterday saying that the Artiphon team is in the final stages of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_for_manufacturability">design for manufacture</a> phase of the production lifecycle and things are on target schedule-wise.  In addition to the production update, Artiphon also announced that they're planning to open up an invite-only pre-order sale where backers can refer folks who are interested in ordering an INSTRUMENT 1 but missed out on the Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<p>The INSTRUMENT 1 will ship with an iOS companion app and can, of course, be used as a controller for any MIDI sound source.  I'm pretty excited to try one out.  It's ostensibly not as sophisticated as, say, the nascent <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/SeaboardR-25">Seaboard RISE</a> from Roli - as far as I can tell the INSTRUMENT 1 doesn't support the Multidimensional Polyphonic Expression MIDI spec - but it's nonetheless a versatile controller that should make MIDI more accessible to guitarists in particular.</p>
<p>It's great to get some insight into the production process for hardware instruments from an <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3049908/innovation-by-design/the-2015-innovation-by-design-awards-winners-product-design">innovative</a> upstart company.  Hopefully production will continue to progress smoothly and come January we'll have a new instrument to add to the burgeoning field of innovative and more <a href="https://factotumo.com/2015/09/seaboard-rise-from-roli/">expressive</a> MIDI controllers.</p>
