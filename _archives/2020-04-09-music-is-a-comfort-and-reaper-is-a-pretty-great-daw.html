<p>Since social distancing became a thing I, like many people, have been spending a lot of time at home.  I've found that music has been a great way to keep my mind engaged and focused on the moment.  It's been a source of comfort during an otherwise stressful time.</p>

<p>It's also been great to see various companies giving away content for free and offering discounts or extended trial licenses.</p>

<p>Ableton is regularly updating an <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/ideas-offers-making-music-home/">Ideas and Offers for Making Music at Home</a> blog post that, among other things (e.g., discounts on Live), has a link to a free download for their book <a href="https://cdn-resources.ableton.com/resources/uploads/makingmusic/MakingMusic_DennisDeSantis.pdf" >Making Music: 74 Creative Strategies for Electronic Music Producers</a>.</p>

<p>One of the more pleasant musical surprises for me has been discovering <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/" class="aioseop-link">REAPER</a>.  I've been a Bitwig Studio user for many years, but a recent bug in the Mac version of 3.1.3 that prevents audio interfaces from working coupled with REAPER offering an <a href="https://cockos.com/reaper/reaper_2020_temporary_license.txt" class="aioseop-link">extended trial license</a> (good through the end of June) led me to give REAPER a try.</p>

<p>I've been pretty impressed with it so far.  It packs a whole lot of functionality into a minimalistic, non-cluttered interface, is highly customizable (via themes and scripting), and has a <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/videos.php" class="aioseop-link">terrific set of instructional videos</a> by <a href="http://www.kennymania.com/" class="aioseop-link">Kenny Gioia</a>.  It doesn't have much in the way of built-in instruments but with a couple of instrument plugins and/or a decent library of samples you'd be well on your way to making music with REAPER.</p>

<p>I've enjoyed REAPER so much over the past few weeks that I could see it becoming my main DAW.  There's a lot I like about Bitwig but it's getting to the point that I find myself using a fraction of its ever-expanding sound design functionality.  By comparison, since REAPER is a more basic DAW and doesn't provide the synthesis and sound design tools that Bitwig does my workflow with REAPER has been more focused and streamlined.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a full-featured DAW and don't need lots of built-in tools for electronic music production, REAPER is a great option, especially when you consider that a <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/purchase.php" class="aioseop-link">non-commercial license</a> (also suitable for commercial use provided annual revenue is less than $20,000) is $60.</p>

<p>Thanks to the talented developers over at <a href="https://www.cockos.com/index.php" class="aioseop-link">cockos inc.</a> for creating REAPER and giving folks a way to make some music and be creative while practicing social distancing.</p>
