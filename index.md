# Hello

My name is Ben Schmaus.

I am a [software developer](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bschmaus) and [musician](/music).

I enjoy chess (and am usually up for an unrated daily game on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/bschmaus) if you'd like to play).

You can find me in various other places on the Internet and, often, in the Greater Philadelphia area of Pennsylvania.
