# Hello

My name is Ben Schmaus.

I am a software developer and musician.

You can find me in various places on the Internet. For example, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/schmaus) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bschmaus).

## Music Projects

I wrote a [console app](/web-midi-console) for viewing MIDI data in a web browser. It's helpful for testing and debugging MIDI gear.

I developed [patch editors](https://editor.meeblip.com) for MeeBlip synthesizers and did an [interview](https://cdm.link/2017/03/web-browser-now-makes-meeblip-synth-powerful-free/) with Create Digital Music.

I write [music](/music) and play guitar.
